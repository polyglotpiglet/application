Feature: Addition
    In Order to avoid silly mistakes
    As a math idiot
    I want to be told the sum of lots of numbers
    
    Scenario: Lots of numbers
        Given I have a calculator
        When I add numbers
        Then the result should be
        |Op1|Op2|sum |
        |---|---|----|
        |42 |99 |141 |
        |42 |-99|-57 |
        |-42|-99|-141|
    
    Scenario: Lots of numbers with mapping
        Given I have a calculator
        When I add numbers
        Then the result should be
        |Op1|Op2|sum |
        |---|---|----|
        |42 |99 |141 |
        |42 |-99|-57 |
        |-42|-99|-141|
